          <h2>What is Radiocut?</h2>
          <p>
            RadioCut is a “crowdclipping” tool that lets users listen to previously aired radio shows (from three minutes after live, to months or years ago), create audio cuts and share them.

          <img height="550" data-src="home-radiocut-us.png">
          <aside class="notes">This is the home page, there you can choose to listen a radiostation or a radio show from all that we are recording.</aside>

          <img data-src="howto-listen.png">
          <aside class="notes">When you click on a radio station, you will start listening that station ten minutes before live, but you can change the time and go back to any time since we started to record this station. And if you find something you want to share, you click 'cut'.</aside>

          <h2>Sharing and virality with Radiocut - A real example</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            Jan 11th 2016 8:45 AM, Victor Hugo Morales one of top radio personalities, opponent to the new government, was fired from his radio (where he worked since 30 years) almost in the air. A few minutes after many users were making audio cuts in radiocut.fm and sharing them on social networks.
          </p>
          <img data-src="vhm.png" class="fragment">
          <aside class="notes">Radiocut is available in Argentina since the end of two-thousand thirteen so we have many examples of how it changed the way radio contents are being shared. This is the last one, when one of the top radio personalities was suddenly fired. Minutes after he told on air that he was being fired by the radio owners, many listeners created audio cuts of this radio moment and shared them.

          As you can see, we had a trafic spike that day, climbing to fifty thoudsand pageviews within an hour. </aside>

            <li>~1% of total Internet users in Argentina in one day</li>
            <li>Many others listened it from audiocuts embeded in top online newspapers</li>
          </ul>
          <img data-src="vhm-en-lanacion.png">
          <aside class="notes">That was around one percent of total Internet users in Argentina in one day. Online newspapers also embed our audiocuts to complement their articles, so many others listened the audio from those sites.

            <li class="fragment"><b>tunein.com</b>: We are not just a radio station directory, we don't limit our users to the live show only. And we offer user classified, selected, described audios.
            </li>
            <li class="fragment"><b>stitcher.com</b>: They focus on radio contents as we do, but radio stations must upload the audio contents and users can't make cuts.
            </li>
            <li class="fragment"><b>Podcasts</b>: they are fine for producer-to-consumer sharing of full and serial episodes. RadioCut fits better for peer-to-peer sharing of small fragments of radiostation contents.
